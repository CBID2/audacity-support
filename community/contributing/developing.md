# Developing Audacity

Audacity is being developed on [Github](https://github.com/audacity/audacity). Most information necessary to contributing code can be found there, such as [building instructions](https://github.com/audacity/audacity/blob/master/BUILDING.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that Audacity currently is undergoing major restructuring. As such, we can't promise a swift review or merge of any pull requests you make.&#x20;

As the codebase is over 20 years old, it's not massively beginner-friendly (though this should get better once the refactor is complete). If you are new to C++, you may want to try doing something else instead first - developing a plugin might be an idea.
