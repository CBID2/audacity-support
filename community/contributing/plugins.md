# Finding & testing plugins

We maintain a list of free VSTs and similar plugins on plugins.audacityteam.org. You can find, test and add plugins to the list.&#x20;

To do this, you can get access to the plugins space via [https://www.audacityteam.org/gitbook-plugins](https://www.audacityteam.org/gitbook-plugins) and then edit the relevant sections.
