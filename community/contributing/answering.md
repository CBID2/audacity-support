# Answering user questions

If you know Audacity well, but don't want to [write tutorials](tutorials/), you can help users out directly. The most active communities in this regard are:&#x20;

* The [Audacity Forum](https://forum.audacityteam.org/),
* the [Discord community](https://discord.gg/T7g45chg3M), and
* the [Audacity subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/audacity/).&#x20;
