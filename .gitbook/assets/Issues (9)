<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Known_Major_Issues_at_Release">Known Major Issues at Release</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Accessibility">Accessibility</span></h3>
<ul><li> Many, but not all parts of the Audacity interface are accessible on Windows and Mac (<i>read the alert above about Mac</i>) to those who can't use a mouse, and/or use a screen reader. It may be possible to make more of Audacity accessible in the longer term. For details, see <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://manual.audacityteam.org/o/man/accessibility.html">https://manual.audacityteam.org/o/man/accessibility.html</a> </li>
<li> <b>There are some accessibility bugs in the parts of Audacity that are accessible (or behavior may vary according to the specific screen reader).</b> 
<ul><li> Toolbars that show disabled at View &gt; Toolbars and are then re-enabled will launch undocked if Audacity has already been restarted. <b>Workaround:</b> perform View &gt; Toolbars &gt; Reset Toolbars before enabling any disabled toolbars.</li>
<li> After mouse down to drag a docked toolbar to a new docked or undocked position, the track focus is removed and the selected control loses its focus border even though that toolbar still has focus. When dragging or resizing an already undocked toolbar, the selected control similarly loses its focus border.     </li>
<li> shortcuts for Up, Down, Left, Right, Return and NUMPAD ENTER  </li>
<li> Selection Toolbar: The End/Length buttons do not have a dotted rectangle to indicate when they have focus, and keyboard arrow keys no longer move between the buttons. The names of the buttons are either not read by screen readers or the position of both options is incorrectly read as 1 of 1. </li>
<li> Keyboard Preferences: Window-Eyes doesn't read the key bindings when View by Tree is selected, and may not always read the bindings in other views. VoiceOver and Orca do not read the key bindings at all. You could export the bindings, modify them in a text editor then import the modified list. </li>
<li> Spectral Selection Toolbar:  
<ul><li> You can't enter a new low frequency first if it is above the current high frequency - in that case, you must enter the new high frequency first. </li>
<li> If you change low and high frequencies to kHz, then typing or incrementing values in the High Frequencies box has unpredictable results.</li></ul></li>
<li> It is not possible to use the keyboard to move the cursor or selection region to an arbitrary position when playing or recording. However you can use the [ or ] shortcuts respectively to set the left or right boundary of the selection at the playback or recording position ( <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/edit_menu_select.html#left">https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/edit_menu_select.html#left</a> ). Different <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/scrubbing_and_seeking.html">Scrubbing</a> modes may also be started using shortcuts or the Transport Menu, but there is no keyboard interface yet to control scrubbing. Scrubbing may be started by shortcut even if the pointer is in the waveform, although the Status Bar messages don't refer to moving the pointer to Scrub.  </li>
<li> <b>(Windows):</b> 
<ul><li> Edit toolbar buttons that depend on selection are (at least in NVDA) announced as Disabled when there is no selection, rather than being skipped over. Hitting ENTER on such a disabled button will auto-select the audio, applying the edit to all of that automatic selection.  </li>
<li> In certain parts of the main window, NVDA does not speak typed characters (JAWS and Window-Eyes are not affected):</li>
<li> In the main window, not speaking a character if it is a command for example, j,k,[ or ]</li>
<li> In a label track, not speaking characters typed into a label.</li></ul></li>
<li> <b>(OS X/macOS):</b>
<ul><li> Audacity is not yet fully Retina-ready. It is known that the Track Control Panel appears fuzzy. Please <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.audacityteam.org/contact/#feedback">let us know</a> of any other issues. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://retinizer.mikelpr.com/">Retinizer</a> can no longer be applied to Audacity. If Retinizer is applied to previous Audacity this will prevent the export format being changed. </li>
<li> <b>Selection is not in the first control of Generators, Effects or Analyzers.</b> In most effects the selection is invisible and one TAB puts selection in the Manage Button. In Change Speed the selection is "Current Length" and in Change Pitch the selection is the first octave.  </li>
<li> If you apply a real-time preview effect while focus has remained in Audacity, the effect loses focus. If you apply a real-time preview effect after task switching away from and back to Audacity, the effect will go behind the project window. The effect may be brought back to focus in both cases with ALT + F6. </li>
<li> It is not possible to move between the main Audacity window and some VST and Audio Unit effects using the ALT + F6 or ALT + SHIFT + F6 shortcuts when the effect is in Graphical Mode. You can use the "Manage" menu then Options... to change the effect to textual mode.    </li></ul></li>
<li> <b>(OS X/macOS) Issues with VoiceOver:</b></li></ul></li></ul>

<td align="left" valign="top">Unfortunately, current Audacity is not accessible for users of VoiceOver for the reasons given below. This was also the case for releases starting from Audacity 2.1.1. However, an accessible version of Audacity 2.1.1 is available on our <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://audacityteam.org/download/mac">Mac OS X downloads page</a>. The name of this accessible version is "2.1.1-screen-reader" (DMG and ZIP downloads are available). It is hoped that future versions of Audacity will be accessible for users of VoiceOver.
</td></tr></table>
</div>
<ul><ul><li> (reported on OS X 10.9.x) After exporting, the black accessibility area is trapped in the Tooldock area, so there is no way to read the tracks. <b>Workaround:</b> Save as a project, close the project then reopen it. You can then navigate the tracks with VoiceOver.
<li> If you use arrow keys to navigate the Timetext controls in Selection Toolbar, VoiceOver stops reading. <b>Workaround:</b> Use Control-Option-W 
<li> When you TAB forwards from "Audio Position" in Selection Toolbar, the "Selection End" or "Selection Length" radio button is read as "Selection Start". When you use COMMAND + F6 or COMMAND + SHIFT + F6 to move directly into "Selection End" from another toolbar, the button is read as "Selection Start". 
<li> Mixer Toolbar input/output sliders are not read, but just described as "multiple indicators". The "Graphic EQ"  and vertical sliders in Equalization *are* read.
<li> Metadata Editor table not read.
<li> Edit Labels dialog not read.
<li> In the "Edit Chains" window, only the first command in the "Chain" list is read, and it is only read when first accessed. In the "Select Command" window for inserting a new command in a Chain, commands in the table are not read.
<li> "Manage Curves" table in Equalization not read.</ul>
<li>
<b>GNU/Linux:</b>
<ul><li>(Linux Ubuntu) Under Unity, keyboard shortcuts are not visible in the Audacity menus. Keyboard shortcuts are visible if you install the classic <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2014/04/install-gnome-classic-desktop-in-ubuntu-14-04/">GNOME Flashback</a> interface or under Unity if you open Audacity from the termimal with

<tr>
<td>env UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0 audacity
</td></tr></table>
<p>Audacity will now ship with src/audacity.desktop.in set to UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0 so Audacity compiled from source will show shortcuts in the menus and will have its own menu bar in the application. It will remain up to Ubuntu whether they use this desktop file in packaged versions of Audacity.    
</p>
<li> Access keys mostly do not work except for radio buttons and checkboxes.  
<li> (Linux with Xfce desktop) It is not possible to move forward through modeless windows, undocked Toolbars and the main project window using ALT + F6. You may move backward using ALT + SHIFT + F6, but focus may get trapped in windows or undocked toolbars.
<li> (Linux) <b>It is not possible to TAB through the search box in Keyboard Preferences.</b> However, as long as the "Tree" or "Name" button is selected, you can use DOWN arrow to move out of the Search box into the list, then TAB into the lower controls. 
<li>(Linux) <b>Playing or recording then stopping causes the currently focused track or tooldock area to lose focus.</b> Some shortcuts for example those for Tools Toolbar will then not work until focus is restored. <b>Workaround:</b> To restore focus, deliver a mouse click in the interface or create a shortcut for Reset Toolbars and use that shortcut. 
<li>(Linux) TAB unexpectedly navigates out of the current tooldock area instead of staying inside it, and CTRL + F6 from Selection Toolbar and SHIFT + CTRL + F6 from the Tracks table do not navigate to the upper tooldock area but leave focus in the previous toolbar. However you can use the TAB navigation behavior described above to access the upper tooldock area. 
<li> (Linux) The shortcut to "Move backward from toolbars to tracks" does not cycle from the audio track to upper tooldock, only to Selection Toolbar. The shortcut to "Move forward from toolbars to tracks" does not cycle from Selection Toolbar to upper tooldock, only to the audio track.</ul>
<li> <b>(Linux) Issues with Orca:</b> 
<ul><li> Audacity tracks are not read. 
<li> Not all toolbar controls are read, examples being Timetext controls, Project Rate and controls in Device Toolbar.
<li> Not all controls in Preferences are read.
<li> Control labels for Vamp and VST plugins are not read.
<li> Control labels for Nyquist plugins are read inconsistently in older version 3 or earlier plugins (Version 4 seems to read more consistently).</ul></ul></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Analysis_effects">Analysis effects</span></h3>
<ul><li> (Linux Ubuntu) <b>On high resolution monitors, Plot Spectrum may initialize with the lower part of the display and the effect controls off the bottom of the monitor.</b> As a <b>Workaround:</b> you could try holding ALT and pressing E on your keyboard to export a text file of the plot.</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Application_Launch">Application Launch</span></h3>
<ul><li> <b>If Audacity 2.1.1 or earlier had the interface language set to "Simplified" (an optional English language that can remove menu items) then current Audacity will show an error on each launch</b> "Language "en-simple" is unknown". No menu items will be hidden. <b>Workaround:</b> To prevent the error occurring at each launch, open Preferences then OK which changes the language to English. 
<ul><li> Simplified menus are also not currently supported in any other languages, but no errors are shown. Menu items that should be hidden will be shown starting with an "!" exclamation mark.</li></ul></li>
<li> (Linux) If a Bluetooth audio device is in use on a PulseAudio system, Audacity may hang on launch on initial attempts, then after eventual launch Bluetooth will no longer work on the system. <b>Workarounds:</b> 
<ul><li> Remove and reconnect the external Bluetooth adaptor, then launch bluetooth-applet from the command line. </li>
<li> To prevent Audacity affecting Bluetooth support, move /usr/share/alsa/bluetooth.conf to another location then reboot, or create a symbolic link from /var/lib/alsa/asound.state to /dev/null and reboot.</li></ul></li>
<li> (Mac and Linux) <b>Audacity will not launch if the temporary directory is set to a USB or hard drive formatted with FAT16, FAT32 or exFAT.</b> To make Audacity launch again, open the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/preferences.html#stored">audacity.cfg settings file</a>. Underneath the [Directories] line, change TempDir to any drive or partition formatted with the operating system's native file system (MacOS Extended (HFS+) on Mac, or ext3/ext4 on Linux).</li>
<li> If you launch Audacity by COMMAND + Space (Spotlight Search) then ENTER (or double-click the search result), a false error prompt appears<b> "The application "Audacity.app" can't be opened" when in fact it will open anyway.</b></li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bugs_requiring_more_investigation">Bugs requiring more investigation</span></h3>
<ul><li> <b>Bass and Treble is a real-time preview effect but may sometimes not be openable when audio is already playing, or adjusting the effect controls may not be audible.</b> You can still apply the effect to the audio as expected.</li>
<li> (Windows Vista or later) On upgrading to current Audacity from earlier versions, "error opening sound device" occurs when recording from the inbuilt sound device where there was no error in the previous Audacity with the same device configuration and operating system. <b>Workaround:</b> Use Transport &gt; Rescan Audio Devices, or go to "Sound" in the Windows Control Panel and click OK. Note that if devices listed in Device Toolbar are disabled in "Sound" then the error is legitimate - you will need to enable those devices. 
<ul><li> Please report make and model number of sound devices that exhibit the issue, along with driver version number. Please first ensure your sound device drivers are up-to-date and not generic Microsoft drivers - help available <a href="/wiki/Updating_Sound_Device_Drivers" title="Updating Sound Device Drivers">here</a>.</li></ul></li>
<li> (Windows Vista) If you change the input volume in Audacity and then record, the volume is reset to its original level. This appears to occur mostly with a few specific USB devices, and sometimes only on Vista SP1, so it is currently hard for us to fix. <b>Workaround:</b> Check if the manufacturer supplies their own drivers for the device and try those. See if upgrading to Vista SP2 or Windows 7 helps.
<ul><li> Please report make and model number of devices that exhibit the issue, also the drivers and exact version of  Vista and Service Pack in use (for example, Vista 32-bit, SP1)</li></ul></li>
<li> (Windows) Some devices that used to offer multiple recording channels in Audacity without ASIO may now only offer mono or stereo recording instead of the expected number of channels. Usually the multi or similar device only has 2 channels instead of the expected number. Occasionally the multi device is missing, leaving only two-channel devices to choose from. These devices have been reported:
<ul><li> Alesis Multimix-8 USB</li>
<li> DSP2000-CPort</li>
<li> M-Audio Delta 66</li>
<li> Motu 896 AD/DA FW</li>
<li> Tascam US 1641 and US 1800</li></ul></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style-image: none; list-style-type: none">
If you experience this issue please report make and model number of the device, your operating system (for example, Windows 7 Service Pack 1) and the device driver version number you are using. It is possible that more than stereo recording may be possible if you can find earlier drivers that are still compatible with your version of Windows, or if you try the Windows WASAPI host in <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://manual.audacityteam.org/o/man/device_toolbar.html">Device Toolbar</a>. See <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Multichannel_Recording">Multichannel Recording</a> for a list of devices reported to record multi-channels into Audacity without ASIO.</ul>
<ul><li> (Windows) There may be substantial delays drawing the waveform in longer projects of an hour or more. The main problems are with opening saved projects that were fitted to the window, and fitting already zoomed in projects to the window, such as a new recording. Additionally:
<ul><li> Opening and closing large projects one after the other may eventually cause project opening to slow significantly</li>
<li> Import or effect progress dialogs may stall "whited out" for a few seconds after the progress bars complete before the waveform is drawn.</li></ul></li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Chains">Chains</span></h3>
<ul><li> <b>Audacity's built-in generators don't yet work intuitively with Chains.</b> In particular, using the generator from the Generate Menu resets the Chain to use the settings last used from the Generate Menu. Plugin generators should work better with Chains.</li>
<li> <b>Chains do not currently support export as AIFF, Other uncompressed files or any formats supported by FFmpeg.</b></li>
<li> <b>For some effects (Equalization is a known example) parameters stored in Chains may not persist are not independent of the settings saved when running the effect from the Effect Menu.</b> Changing the effect parameters from the Effect menu will thus change the effect parameters stored in the Chain and vice-versa. <b>Workaround:</b> For Equalization, you can use Save / Manage Curves... to save the required curve as a named curve, then choose that curve from the "Select Curve:" dropdown when setting the parameters for the Chain command.</li>
<li> <b>You cannot set export format options or export sample rate in the Chain.</b> If you need to specify export options other than the current default, import or generate some audio, File &gt; Export, select the audio type, click "Options..." then choose and save the option and cancel the export.</li>
<li> (Windows) <b>LV2 effects can only be used in a Chain at their default settings.</b></li>
<li><b>Noise Reduction does not yet support storing its parameters in a Chain.</b> Noise Reduction will run at its last used settings if used in a Chain.</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Compiling">Compiling</span></h3>
<ul><li> <b>Audacity cannot build against wxWidgets compiled with STL.</b> . There will be many errors of the form "cannot convert ‘const wxString’ to ‘const wxChar*". The best approach to a solution has not been decided, but if you would like to help with this please start a discussion on our <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/audacity-devel">audacity-devel</a> mailing list.</li>
<li> (Windows) LADSPA effects cannot be categorized even when Audacity is compiled with USE_LIBLRDF defined.</li>
<li>(Linux) Audacity may not always compile against supported versions of libav or FFmpeg. Audacity 2.0.6 and later supports FFmpeg 1.2 to 2.3.x (or libav 0.8 to 0.10.x). 
<ul><li> Dynamic loading (as in default Audacity ./configure) requires building against the FFmpeg project - it will not build against the libav* headers from the libav project. <b>Workarounds:</b> Configure Audacity with --disable-dynamic-loading. If dynamic loading is required, build against FFmpeg instead of libav, or you can build against libav if you remove the "#define IS_FFMPEG_PROJECT 1" line in src/FFmpeg.h.</li>
<li> Audacity may still build against no-longer-supported FFmpeg versions (such as FFmpeg 0.8 which is system-installed on Debian Wheezy), but configuring with --disable-dynamic-loading will be necessary. FFmpeg 0.8 has at least one known issue in Audacity 2.0.6 or later: mono WMA files export with no audio data. This issue will not be fixed given FFmpeg 0.8 is no longer supported by Audacity 2.0.6.   </li>
<li> Building against self-compiled FFmpeg 2.2.2 with --disable-dynamic-loading the only argument fails on Ubuntu 13.10 with "undefined reference to 'av_codec_is_encoder'". <b>Workaround:</b> Configuring with --disable-dynamic-loading and --with-lib-preference="local" (or at least  --with-ffmpeg="local") may build successfully, but may not disable Libraries Preferences. The best solution may be not to disable dynamic loading.</li></ul></li></ul>

<ul><li> <b>(macOs) Equalizaton:</b> Switching to the "Telephone" or "RIAA" curve may display a flat line curve at about 90dB, and produce no sound when clicking the "Preview" or "OK" buttons. <b>Workaround</b>- switch to Graphic mode.</li>
<li> <b>Effects, Generators or Analyzers plug-ins (except Nyquist) that are no longer available remain listed in the menus until you open the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/manage_effects_generators_and_analyzers.html">Plug-in Manager</a>.</b> The plugins will then be removed from the menus after restarting Audacity. This also applies to previously shipped plug-ins that are no longer available in current Audacity, such as Hard Limiter.</li>
<li> <b>Equalization</b>: do not use the "Manage &gt; Save Preset" function to save a custom curve; use "Save / Manage Curves" instead. Using the "Manage" button to save and recall presets can cause unexpected results, and in rare cases can cause Audacity to hang.</li>
<li> <b>Identically-named effects cannot be differentiated in the "Select Command" dialog in chain editing.</b> When clicking "Edit Parameters", Audacity will show the dialog for one version of the effect, regardless of which one is selected in the "Select Command" list.</li>

<ul><li> <b>Nyquist effects may crash Audacity if used on extremely long selections</b> containing more than 2^31 samples (just over 13.5 hours at 44100 Hz). <b>Workaround</b> Apply the effect to multiple shorter regions (you can drag the selection back on itself to create a region contiguous with the previous one).</li>
<li> Many Nyquist plug-ins will fail or may be sluggish if the track selection is too long, or could cause Audacity to crash. This is because the maximum selection length is limited by the amount of available ram, up to a maximum of 2 GB. <b>Workaround:</b> Unless you know that a particular Nyquist plug-in is safe to use with long selections, do not select more than about 1 hour of audio (44100 Hz sample rate) at a time. For higher sample rates the limit is proportionally less. If necessary, apply the effect to sections of 1 hour or less.</li>
<li> Nyquist effects render the space between clips as silence. <b>Workaround:</b> Edit &gt; Clip Boundaries &gt; Detach at Silences (this may also remove parts of the original audio if any of it was totally silent).</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Effects_.28Real-time_preview.29">Effects (Real-time preview)</span></h3>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Effects_and_Analysis">Effects and Analysis</span></h3>
<ul><li> (Windows 64-bit) There is no  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ registry key where Audacity detects VST plug-ins. The HKEY_CURRENT_USER key searched is HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\VST\VSTPluginsPath instead of the expected HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\VST .</li>
<li> <b>"Classic Filters" which can be enabled at Add / Remove Plug-ins has no vertical scale for the graph.</b></li>
<li> <b>Noise Reduction values are not validated, so unwanted results may occur.</b> Entering a negative value for Noise Reduction can lead to severe overamplification of the audio, and entering values well above the slider values for the Sensitivity and Frequency smoothing parameters can lead to excessive deamplification.</li>
<li> <b>Noise reduction:</b> Preview is not possible if the sample rate of the project is different from the rate of the track to be processed - an error message appears "Sample rate of the noise profile must match that of the sound to be processed" (even if that condition is met). Providing the noise profile rate does match the track rate, you can still apply the effect. Alternatively, change the project rate temporarily to the rate of the track.</li>
<li> <b>Plot Spectrum and Contrast cannot currently be removed from the Analyze Menu.</b></li>
<li> (Linux) <b>On Ubuntu with the Unity interface enabled in audacity.desktop, previewing a built-in or Nyquist effect or generator in one project then opening the same effect or generator in another project will cause a crash.</b> There may sometimes be a crash if opening any built-in or Nyquist effect or generator in another project when such an effect is already previewing.</li>
<li> (Linux) <b>Opening the "Help on the Internet" dialog from the Help menu or from Contrast... creates an additional empty and unclosable dialog, and the real help dialog asserts when  closed.</b> Be sure to press "Continue" in the assertion error dialog. If you press "Stop", Audacity will force quit.</li>
<li> (Linux) <b>Sliding Time Scale / Pitch Shift may crash randomly in Audacity built with pre-2.0.2 versions of libsbsms.</b> This may occur for example in the Ubuntu package of Audacity 2.0.5 on Ubuntu 14.04. <b>Workaround:</b> Build Audacity configured --with-sbsms="local", or use the Audacity package in Ubuntu 14.10 which uses libsbsms 2.0.2-1.</li>
<li> (Mac) <b>Typing or pasting values in the parameter boxes of the </b>Reverb<b> effect will either not change the parameter applied or set it to zero</b>, as shown by the slider positions. <b>Workaround:</b> User the sliders to set effect parameters. To do so using the keyboard, CTRL + F7 if necessary to enable Full Keyboard Access, then TAB into the slider and use arrow keys or Page Up/Down.</li>
<li> (Windows and Linux) Some LADSPA "Blop" plug-ins ( <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://blop.sourceforge.net/index.html">http://blop.sourceforge.net/index.html</a> ) are reported to crash in Audacity on Linux Debian.

<li> (Windows and Mac OS X) The SC4 compressor shipped with Audacity crashes if used in a Chain.</li>
<li> (Windows) <b>Very rarely, Audacity may show no built-in effects, generators or analyzers after upgrading from an earlier Audacity 2.1.x version.</b> If this happens, open Effect &gt; Add / Remove Plug-ins..., enable the built-in effects if not already showing as enabled, then click OK.</li>
<li> (Windows) LADSPA Multiband EQ may not be visible in Effect menu (occurs on Windows XP), and crashes soon after opening</li>
<li> (macOS) <b>Many items in the Generate, Effect and Analyze menus (except for example Plot Spectrum) cannot by default be applied/closed by ENTER on the keyboard unless you first press TAB once.</b> Effects which have no text boxes for input values, such as Audacity's Compressor or most VST or Audio Unit Effects will not respond to the TAB workaround.
<ul><li>  An alternative which avoids having to use TAB is to CTRL + F7 once to enable <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204434#fullkeyboard">Full Keyboard Access</a> for all applications. In any case, without this setting enabled, it will be impossible to navigate dialog buttons or Audacity Preferences using only the keyboard.</li></ul></li>

<li> The following effects <b>remove envelope control points</b>:
<ul><li> Change Speed/Pitch/Tempo; Equalization; Noise Removal; Sliding Time Scale/Pitch Shift; any Nyquist effect in the Effect menu. Workaround: Use Tracks &gt; Mix and Render to apply the envelope to the waveform before applying the effect. </li>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Exports">Exports</span></h3>
<ul><li> <b>WAVEX (Microsoft) headers:</b> GSM 6.10 files cannot be exported with WAVEX headers. Use WAV headers instead (note that GSM 6.10 only supports mono). A-Law and U-Law files with WAVEX headers may not be playable - use WAV headers instead. Choose "Other uncompressed files" then "Options..." to export to GSM 6.10 or A-/U-Law with WAV headers.</li>
<li> <b>When exporting, tracks with Mute button down are excluded from the export mix as intended</b> but currently no warning is provided about this.</li>
<li> (Linux) Exports using "M4A (AAC) Files" are very slow irrespective of the AAC encoder FFmpeg is configured to use.  Workaround: choose (external program) when exporting, entering an appropriate path and command (for example, /usr/bin/ffmpeg -i - "%f") to run FFmpeg using Audacity's command-line encoder.</li>
<li> (Linux) Files exported using the <b>FFmpeg native AAC encoder</b> included with many system versions of FFmpeg may be of poor quality. This is an issue with the library itself. <b>Workaround:</b> When compiling FFmpeg, configure with the libfaac encoder thus: --disable-encoder=aac --enable-libfaac --enable-nonfree. Note that libfaac has an issue not present in the native FFmpeg encoder that saved files are short at the end by about 3000 samples. Alternatively build the VisualOn AAC encoder library and configure FFmpeg with --disable-encoder=aac --disable-encoder=libfaac --enable-libvo-aacenc. </li>
<li> (Linux) Mono AAC files import as stereo if FFmpeg uses the libfaad decoder. This is again an issue with the library itself.</li>
<li> (Mac OS X) <b>When exporting using (external program) using any encoder, or using "Custom FFmpeg Export", you must agree to create and replace an unwanted "NoOverwritePrompt" file before you can export.</b> The exported audio file is correct.</li>
<li> (OS X) <b>If you include / in the file name when using File &gt; Export Audio... or Export Selected Audio..., the text before the / will be missing from the exported file name.</b> As a <b>Workaround:</b> add the required file name to a label then Export Multiple.</li>
<li> (macOS) <b>The Export Multiple progress dialogues may be hidden behind the Export Multiple window for each file after the first one.</b> Files are still exported normally, and you can move the Export Multiple window to one side to view the subsequent progress dialogues.  The confirmation dialogue listing the exported files appears normally on top of Export Multiple after export completes.</li>
<li> Audacity may freeze if using the Nero AAC encoder to export via (external program). It is reported this only occurs when using multiple CPU cores. <b>Workaround:</b> Export to AAC directly by adding <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://manual.audacityteam.org/o/man/faq_installation_and_plug_ins.html#ffdown">FFmpeg</a> to your computer, or set Audacity to use only one CPU core.</li>
<li> Custom FFmpeg Export: many combinations of formats and codecs are incompatible, as are some combinations of general options and codecs. Some files may be exported as zero kb files.</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Imports_and_Exports">Imports and Exports</span></h3>
<ul><li> <b>A-Law, U-Law and ADPCM export formats (also RF64 for PCM exports larger than 4 GB in size) must be chosen by selecting "Other uncompressed files", ensure the "Header" is "WAV (Microsoft)", then from the "Encoding" dropdown menu select your desired encoding.  We may redesign the export list in due course to make these formats easier to find.</b></li>
<li> <b>AAC exports using "M4A (AAC) Files (FFmpeg)" with project rate below 22050 Hz produce a zero bytes file if the linked to FFmpeg is configured with the default AAC encoder or libfaac. This will not affect the recommended builds of FFmpeg for Windows and Mac OS X which are built with libvo-aacenc. </b>Workaround:<b> You can export AAC below 22050 Hz using default-configured FFmpeg by choosing (external program) export instead.</b></li>
<li> <b>Files containing PCM audio but misnamed as MP3 cause a freeze or crash</b> if an Extended Import rule is set in Preferences to force import of MP3 files using the MP3 importer.</li>
<li> <b>ID3 metadata tags in imported MP3 or MP2 files may display incorrectly if the metadata is UTF-16 encoded.</b> The tags will seem to have Chinese characters and these incorrect tags will also be present if the files are re-exported. <b>Workaround:</b> Before importing the file into Audacity, open it in a tag editor or an audio application that can edit tags. If the tags are seen correctly, save the file in that application. On Windows you can use <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.foobar2000.org/download">Foobar2000</a> for this purpose.</li>
<li> <b>On a fresh installation of Audacity or <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/preferences.html#stored">initialized Preferences</a>, the "FFmpeg-compatible files" filter cannot be used to make FFmpeg import native Audacity formats such as WAV, AIFF or MP3.</b> Similarly on macOS, the "QuickTime files" filter cannot be used to make QuickTime import MPEG-4 files instead of installed FFmpeg.<b>Workaround:</b> Open Preferences and click "OK" then the FFmpeg and QuickTime filters will work as expected.</li>
<li> <b>The Import / Export Preference "When importing audio files, Normalize all tracks in project" will cause import of WAV/AIFF files using "Read the files directly from the original" to lock up at the Normalize step.</b> If you require normalize on import for WAV/AIFF, please change the Import / Export Preference to "Make a copy... before editing".</li>
<li> <b>When exporting using the "Other uncompressed files" option, the extension of the exported file is forced to the default for the format.</b> For example it is not possible to export AIFF files with .aif or .aifc extension except by using the "AIFF (Apple) signed 16-bit PCM" option instead.</li>
<li> (Linux) <b>When using Export Multiple, asterisks (*) or question marks (?) in track names or labels are wrongly rejected as illegal characters.</b> As a <b>Workaround</b> you can force use of * or&#160;? by exporting each region with File &gt; Export Selected Audio... instead.</li>
<li> (Linux) After opening a sufficiently long audio file, opening a second file of any size might lead to locked GUI/console messages until the first file completes play.</li>
<li> (Mac OS X) Dragging audio files to Audacity's icon in the Dock will only import the file for WAV, AIFF, AU, MP2, MP3, OGG, FLAC and M4A. <b>Workaround:</b> Rename MP4 files (audio or video) to M4A extension. Alternatively the files may be dragged to the Audacity icon in the folder where you have Audacity installed, dragged into the open Audacity window or imported using the Audacity menus.</li>
<li> (OS X Pre El Capitan) <b>iTunes files cannot be opened from Media &gt; Music in the Sidebar in Audacity's file open dialogs.</b> You could drag your iTunes "Music" folder to the Finder sidebar to give quicker access in Audacity open dialogs.</li>
<li> (OS X) <b>When exporting using the "Other uncompressed files" option, the "Save As:" dropdown always offers .aiff extension even when other headers are chosen.</b> However the file will be exported in the correct format with the correct default extension for that format, even if you don't change the Save As extension from AIFF.</li>
<li> (OS X) Files imported from iTunes could create invalid characters in the .aup project file in previous Beta versions of Audacity. If you re-open such a project in the current release, an error "reference to invalid character number" may occur. <b>Workaround:</b> Save and open a back-up copy of the .aup file in a text editor, turn off word wrap, then in the line indicated in the error message, remove the string of characters that starts with &amp;# and ends with a semi-colon (;). There is more help with fixing this <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://manual.audacityteam.org/o/man/faq_errors.html#nwf">here</a>.</li>
<li> (Windows Vista, 7) Audacity will crash if attempting to open WAV files while they are still being rendered by the open source Psycle tracker program.</li>
<li> If WAV/AIFF files are imported into a project using "Read Directly" import but then become unavailable, warnings are given when playing, recording, applying effects and exporting, but not all editing and project save actions are warned.</li>
<li> If you import an audio file from a folder other than the one you last exported to, you cannot export over that file without changing the export directory manually.</li>
<li>"Background on-demand loading" for FFmpeg (in the Libraries Preferences) does not currently allow changing the focus of waveform computation by clicking in the track. You can apply an effect to a selection wherever the normal waveform has appeared, but if you do so before the normal waveform has appeared, the audio will be silenced.</li>
<li><b>(Linux):</b> When exporting to MIDI over an existing file, no overwrite warning is given.</li>
<li><b>By default, the importer used depends on the import method.</b> For example, to be able to use <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://manual.audacityteam.org/o/man/faq_installation_and_plug_ins.html#ffdown">FFmpeg</a> to import native Audacity formats like WAV and MP3, you must choose the "FFmpeg-compatible files" filter in File &gt; Open or File &gt; Import &gt; Audio and <b>always use one of those import methods</b>. To force FFmpeg to import native Audacity formats when using File &gt; Recent Files or dragging in, add rules for those formats in <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://manual.audacityteam.org/o/man/extended_import_preferences.html">Extended Import Preferences</a>. To force FFmpeg import irrespective of the filter when using File &gt; Open or File &gt; Import &gt; Audio, uncheck "Attempt to use filter in OpenFile dialog first" in Extended Import Preferences as well as adding the rule for the format.</li>
<li><b>Export Multiple does not pass metadata common to all tracks to the Metadata Editor windows for each track.</b> <b>Workaround:</b> Export by unchecking "Show Metadata Editor before export step" in Import / Export Preferences, then enter any tags common to all tracks at Edit &gt; Metadata... before exporting. Audacity will then silently add the common and automatically generated Track Title and Track Number tags for each exported file.</li>
<li><b>WAV and AIFF exports will fail without warning</b> if you import a WAV or AIFF by <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://manual.audacityteam.org/o/man/import_export_preferences.html">reading it directly</a>, delete the file and its track then export new audio to the same file name and location as the deleted file. <b>Workaround:</b> Set the Preference in the above link to "Make a copy" of uncompressed files when importing.</li>
<li>(OS X) Audio files containing a backslash (\) in the name will fail "Could not open file" if you import them using File &gt; Open... , File &gt; Import &gt; Audio... or File &gt; Open Recent. This is a bug in wxWidgets. <b>Workaround:</b> Drag the file into the Audacity window instead.</li>
<li><div id="dither"></div></li>
<li> <b><a href="/wiki/Dither" title="Dither">Dither</a> (corrective soft noise) is applied by default when it should not be applied</b> when exporting to most formats having the same or higher bit depth than the project. For example, this occurs if exporting to 16-bit WAV, 16-bit FLAC or MP3 from a 16-bit project. OGG is unaffected. <b>Workarounds:</b> Set "High Quality" dither to "None" in the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://manual.audacityteam.org/o/man/quality_preferences.html">Quality Preferences</a>. To fix any files that have already been affected, see <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://forum.audacityteam.org/viewtopic.php?f=28&amp;t=38756">this Forum topic</a>.</li>
<li><div id="metadata"></div></li>
<li> Metadata: 
<ul><li> Album art and lyrics in imported metadata are lost when exporting. <b>Workaround:</b> Copy the lyrics (or search for them online) then add them back to the exported file in your favorite media player. Extract the album art using a tag editor such as <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/idteid3tagedito/">IDTE</a> (or use <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/add-change-media-player-album-art#1TC=windows-7">Windows Media Player</a> or iTunes to search online for the art) then add the art back to the exported file using your media player.    </li>
<li> Tags other than the seven default <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://manual.audacityteam.org/o/man/metadata_editor.html">Metadata Editor</a> tags will be rewritten as custom ID3 TXXX tags, which will cause them not to be seen in applications like Windows Media Player and iTunes. Common tag examples include "Album Artist", "BPM" and "Composer".</li>
<li> ID3 v2.4 tags in imported MP3 files are not seen and will be removed on export.</li>
<li> Audacity writes both ID3 v2.3 (TYER) and v2.4 (TDRC) tags for "Year", but any applications that require the older TYER on its own (without TDRC) will not see "Year" in Audacity-exported files. The id3 command-line application on Linux is one example.  </li>
<li> WMA and APE (Monkeys Audio): "Artist Name" is not seen on importing the file (Audacity bug) </li>
<li> Other metadata import/export may not always be consistent. This may depend on the program that created the imported tags and the program used to read the exported tags.</li></ul></li>
<li>When importing a MIDI track, the channel selection buttons to left of the track are not currently available.</li></ul>

<li> M4A (AAC) exports: The Quality Slider in "Specify AAC Options" has no effect if the FFmpeg library is built with the libvo-aac encoder, as are recommended builds of FFmpeg for Windows and Mac OS X. <b>Workaround:</b> You can specify a constant bit rate if you select "Custom FFmpeg Export". Click the Options... button, choose "mp4" in the formats list and "libvo_aacenc" in the codecs list, then set bit rate in bits per second. Up to 320000 bps (320 kbps) is supported. Given the alternative AAC encoders for FFmpeg also have problems as described in these notes, you can instead export as WAV and convert to AAC in iTunes on Windows and Mac.</li>

<li> On Mac, keyboard bindings will open first time in Applications if you have not already exported or saved any files. You must change the export directory to save if you are not running as administrator. If you cancel keyboard bindings export after it offers the Applications directory, all other TXT and XML exports will then default to saving in Applications.       </li>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Interface">Interface</span></h3>
<ul><li> <b>Audacity does not alert you if it cannot write to its configuration or settings files</b> or cannot remove its temporary settings files. The problem could occur due to interaction with a virus checker (this is most likely on Windows) or due to permissions problems. 
<ul><li> If the problem occurs, you might find a change you made in Preferences does not take hold, or that changing the settings in an effect then trying to apply the effect won't run the effect. On Windows, you will also find a build up of aud*.tmp or plu*.tmp files in Audacity's <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://manual.audacityteam.org/o/man/preferences.html#stored">Preferences folder for application data</a> though these are noted at Help &gt; Show Log... .</li></ul></li>

This will display all open Audacity project windows enabling to choose any one by clicking it.</li>
<li> After changing language in Preferences, a few parts of the interface don't change until Audacity is restarted.</li>
<li> Crashes on incorrect behaviour on quit:
<ul><li> (Windows) <b>Audacity crashes after quit if quit from the Windows 7 Task Manager and "About Audacity" is open.</b> If you save changes to a project, these changes are saved correctly. </li>
<li> (Windows) <b>Audacity cannot be quit from the Task Bar icon if "About Audacity" is open.</b></li>

<ul><li> Clicking the (?) help button in the "xxx.aup is an Audacity Project File ..." message will take you to an Audacity dialog offering more help - but that help is inappropriate to opening a project.</li>
<li> Further, if the local manual is installed (standard on Windows and Mac, optional according to your download choice on Mac and Windows), clicking the (?) help button in the "xxx.aup is an Audacity Project File ..." and then clicking on the links in the further message will take you to the online Manual and not your local installed Manual - and this will fail if you have no Internet connection.</li></ul></li>

<ul><li>(Windows) It is not yet possible to drag .lnk shortcuts to audio files or projects into Audacity, or to drag them to the Audacity executable's icon. <b>Workaround:</b> Use File &gt; Open or File &gt; Import &gt; Audio, or double-click the shortcut to the .aup from Windows Explorer.</li>
<li>(Windows) The Audacity executable cannot be added to the Explorer "Open with" context menu if you have another version of Audacity on the system which is also called "audacity.exe". <b>Workaround:</b> either use the "Open with" dialogue to browse to the executable each time, or rename the executable to or some other unique name.</li>
<li>Dragging a clip or track up or down with Time Shift Tool does not scroll the project window when tracks exist out of view above or below the scroll. <b>Workaround:</b> Choose View &gt; Fit Vertically before drag, or click and hold the piece to be dragged, use up or down arrow on the keyboard to scroll to the target track, then drag and release the clip or track.</li>
<li>Sync-Locked Tracks are not affected by all actions that change the length of a track in the Sync-Locked Track Group.  Applying Paulstretch or using the Audio Track dropdown menu to change sample rate will leave the other Sync-Locked tracks desynchronised.</li></ul>

<li> (OS X and Linux) Audacity now works very well with <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://jackaudio.org/">JACK</a>, with the following bugs and limitations:
<ul><li> Clicking in the input meter to start monitoring will crash Audacity if it has not yet used JACK for playback or recording in that session. <b>Workaround:</b> Before recording the first track in a session, click "Pause" then "Record" to enable the recording meter.</li>
<li> The best way to connect to available JACK inputs and outputs is directly from Device Toolbar. Use Transport &gt; Rescan Audio Devices when necessary, for example to make new JACK applications ports available to Audacity. See <a href="/wiki/Linux_Issues#JACK" title="Linux Issues">here</a> for details.  </li>
<li> On Mac, Audacity may freeze if JACK is launched by QjackCtl then Audacity is launched. <b>Workaround:</b> Use  JackPilot to launch JACK, or launch QJackCtrl after Audacity and JACK are running.</li></ul></li>
<li> (OS X and Linux) PortAudio's default latency values which are used when recording with software playthrough are much lower than Audacity's default "Audio to buffer" setting. This may cause playthrough or recording glitches when recording  with software playthrough enabled, especially when using pulse on Linux.

<li> (Windows) <b>When you install Audacity for the first time or launch it after resetting Preferences Audacity will choose the named recording and playback devices that are the current Windows default devices</b>, rather then the MME "Sound Mapper" devices which are permanently mapped to whatever the current defaults are. <b>Workaround:</b> If you lose playback audio or only record silence after changing the Windows default devices, use <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://manual.audacityteam.org/o/man/device_toolbar.html">Device Toolbar</a> to change the devices as needed, then Audacity will remember them.</li>
<li> (Windows) Audacity is incompatible (or not fully compatible) with some professional sound cards or audio devices, and may crash or have limited or faulty functionality. Occasionally, this may be true of some AC97 devices built into the motherboard. <b>Workaround:</b> make a different sound card your default when using Audacity, but please e-mail the following details to our <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/contact/#feedback">feedback address</a>:
<ul><li> Your version of Windows and Service Pack</li>
<li> Name, model number and driver version number of the sound card or device.<p><b>Note:</b> <a href="/wiki/Multichannel_Recording" title="Multichannel Recording">Multichannel Recording</a> in Audacity is often not possible with professional devices unless you compile Audacity with <a href="/wiki/ASIO_Audio_Interface" title="ASIO Audio Interface">ASIO</a> support.</p></li></ul></li>
<li> Adding or removing an external audio device while Audacity is open will not be automatically reflected in the list in Device Toolbar or Devices Preferences. On Mac, unplugging then replugging an external device will give "error while opening sound device" (on Linux, pressing "Record" a second time will remove the error). <b>Workaround:</b> Use Transport &gt; Rescan Audio Devices.</li>
<li> If you move tracks while playing for example using the Audio Track Dropdown Menu, playback does not change, and if you use that menu to Swap Stereo Channels during playback, the left channel is silenced.<b>  Playback responds to the other commands in that menu.</b></li>
<li> Play-at-Speed slider: Change of playback speed is no longer automatic after you move the play-at-speed slider. To change speed, move the slider, then click the green button to left of the slider to play at the new speed.</li>
<li>(Windows Vista, 7) If you change the explicit output and/or input device selected in Device Toolbar or Devices Preferences and then change "Host", the selected devices will change back to those originally selected.</li>
<li>(Windows XP and earlier) Changing the default playback or recording devices in the Windows Control Panel while Audacity is open may cause all the playback or recording choices in Device Toolbar to produce silence (or to fail with "Error opening sound device"). This problem may also occur when connecting or disconnecting a USB device while Audacity is open. <b>Workaround:</b> Click Transport &gt; Rescan Audio Devices then you can play or record.</li>
<li><div id="wasapi"></div></li>
<li> (Windows Vista and later) <b>The "Windows WASAPI" host supplies playback, plus a "loopback" device for <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://manual.audacityteam.org/o/man/tutorial_recording_computer_playback_on_windows.html">recording computer playback</a> and experimental support for physical inputs.</b> <p>Not everyone will necessarily experience all or any of the issues noted below, but please report any WASAPI issues not covered below to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.audacityteam.org/contact/#feedback">our feedback address</a>.</p>
<ul><li> When Windows is installed in a language using Unicode characters (such as Russian or German), WASAPI host in Device Toolbar shows incorrect characters for the names of Playback and Recording subdevices.</li>
<li> Although volume slider support for WASAPI is implemented, on some devices the Mixer Toolbar recording volume slider will be grayed out when selecting the Windows WASAPI host.  Even if the Audacity recording slider is available, the sound device may not support Audacity adjusting its   system playback or recording sliders. To control loopback recording on those systems, try adjusting the playback level of the audio player.</li>
<li>  On many other devices, the Audacity recording and playback volume sliders will be "linked" together when loopback recording with playback and recording device set to the same device. Adjusting either slider will often adjust the sound you hear without affecting the achieved recording level, enabling you to record without listening. If "silent" recording does not work, mute the "Device" slider at far left of the Windows "Volume Mixer" or plug in speakers or headphones and turn off their volume.    </li>
<li> If the achieved loopback recording level is too low, try turning up the volume in the application playing the audio.</li>
<li> Adjusting linked sliders during loopback recording may cause audio breakup or recording glitches.   </li>
<li> Loopback recording may fail "error opening" when Audacity is set to record in mono.</li>
<li> You will normally need to start playing the loopback stream (or to have previously played some other audio in the application you are using for playback) before starting loopback recording in Audacity. </li>
<li> Changing Default Format or Exclusive Mode settings in <a href="/wiki/Mixer_Toolbar_Issues#vistacp" title="Mixer Toolbar Issues">Windows Sound</a> while Audacity is open may cause "error opening" when starting to play or record. Try Transport &gt; Rescan Audio Devices or restarting Audacity.</li>
<li> If you receive dropouts or poor quality when recording, try setting the Audacity <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://manual.audacityteam.org/o/man/selection_toolbar.html">Project Rate</a> to 44100 Hz and setting Default Format in Windows Sound to 44100 Hz, with both "Exclusive Mode" boxes <i>unchecked</i>. Other rates may work, providing the same rate is set in both places. The most likely place for a dropout is within the first second or two of recording. </li>
<li> Physical inputs may fail "error opening", especially when overdub recording. Try setting Audacity project rate to 44100 Hz then for both the playback and the recording device in Windows Sound, ensure both "Exclusive Mode" are <i>checked</i> (enabled). You can also try setting Audacity Project Rate to the same as Windows "Default Format" with both Exclusive Mode boxes <i>unchecked.</i> </li>
<li> Latency when overdubbing may substantially increase shortly after starting the recording.  </li>
<li> "Audio to buffer" in Recording Preferences cannot be used to adjust recording latency.</li>
<li> Non-looped playback plays the selection minus the "Audio to buffer" (for example, standard playback may fail to play the buffered length at the end of the selection). Setting the buffer setting to zero when using WASAPI host may make it more likely that audio will play fully.</li></ul></li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Preferences">Preferences</span></h3>
<ul><li> (Linux) <b>If your project window is not maximised and you OK in Preferences with a label track present, the project window will be resized very narrow and there will be an assert in the terminal and possibly the project.</b> Audacity will not be usable if a whited out assertion dialogue appears in the project window.</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Projects">Projects</span></h3>
<ul><li> <b>If you try to save changes to an already saved project but the save fails, for example due to write error or write protection, only a cryptic error is displayed:</b> "Could not create safety file: &lt;path&gt;\&lt;project name&gt;.aup.bak" (or aup~ on Linux).</li>
<li> <b>Importing an audio file or opening an AUP file may no longer permanently set the Save Project path to where the file came from.</b> After closing the project, Save Project reverts to its previous path. Also if you import an audio file or open an AUP file after importing a MIDI or Labels file, Save Project may not change its path even temporarily.</li>
<li> (OS X and Linux) Entering a backslash "\" in a file name when saving a project gives a "Could not save project. Path not found." error.</li>
<li> (macOS) <b>The button order in the "Save Changes?" dialog changed in 2.1.2 to a less Mac-like sequence of Cancel, No. Yes.</b></li>
<li> Projects created by Audacity 1.1.x or earlier are no longer supported. Workaround: Export each project track as WAV using the appropriate legacy version of Audacity, then import the WAV files into current Audacity.</li>
<li> Projects created by Audacity 1.2.x are partially supported - there is a possibility Audacity could corrupt them. Please make a backup copy of the project's .aup file and _data folder to a new folder before opening the project in this version of Audacity. Once you save the project in this version, it cannot be opened in 1.2.</li>
<li> Projects created by previous versions of Audacity may contain audio "block files" longer than the project format allows. Reopening such projects in previous versions might or might not result in deletion of the overlong audio. Audacity has been provisionally fixed so that it can no longer create or delete overlong files, but it cannot read any such files it encounters. If overlong files are found, a "Problems Reading Sequence Tags" message will display .
<ul><li>  If you continue with the offered repair then choose "Continue without deleting" in the Orphan Block File(s) dialogue, the overlong files will be retained as "orphans" in the project's _data folder but will appear as silence in the track(s). </li>
<li> As long as you choose "Close project immediately" in the Orphan Block File(s) dialogue,  the project will quit and will not be changed in any way.</li></ul></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style-image: none; list-style-type: none">
If you encounter the "Problems Reading Sequence Tags" message, please write to our <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/contact/#feedback">feedback address</a> with a copy of the .aup file and the log as found at Help &gt; Show Log.</ul>
<ul><li> Time Track warp points saved in a 2.0.3 or later project will be preserved if opened in previous Audacity versions, but playback and display will be incorrect.</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Scrubbing_and_Seeking">Scrubbing and Seeking</span></h3>
<ul><li> <b>Currently we allow Scrub or Seek to be paused, but there are two problems if Pause is used:</b>
<ul><li> Unlike during other paused playback, menu items cannot be clicked on in order to stop playback and carry out the requested action. If you pause scrubbing, press ESC, SPACE or the Stop button when you want to edit.</li>
<li> If you start Scrub or Seek by menu item, Scrub Toolbar button or shortcut then engage Pause, move the mouse then release Pause, moving or dragging will not start Scrub or Seek. If you click and release in Scrub Ruler then engage Pause, move the mouse then release Pause, moving the mouse will not start Scrub.</li></ul></li>
<li> <b>Horizontal scrolling is permitted during Scrubbing and Seeking</b> although it is unhelpful for the waveform to shift while in Scrub mode. If you are using a Magic Mouse on MacOS (or other mouse with a control surface) be careful not to brush the mouse surface during Scrub, or try temporarily disbling horizontal scroll in the mouse's preferences.</li>
<li> <b>Scrubbing or Seeking with Pinned head:</b>
<ul><li> <b>To Scrub at normal 1x forwards speed without using the mouse wheel</b> it is always necessary to move the mouse to the end of the window, even if the project is shorter than the window width. To backwards play at 1x, move the pointer to the start of the project. You can Seek at 1x with the pointer in the center of the window.</li>
<li> <b>If you try to forwards scroll-scrub in a less than half-width project</b> by moving the mousewheel downwards to <i>reduce</i> backwards speed, moving the pointer to the end of the window will then achieve less than 1x speed. In that case, move the mousehweel upwards. </li>
<li> <b>You cannot easily forwards-scrub from the start of the audio</b> or backwards-scrub from the end of the audio because playback might cease before the pointer moves far enough to change playback direction. Enabling "scrolling left of zero" in <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/tracks_preferences.html">Tracks Preferences</a> will make scrubbing easier for these use cases.</li></ul></li>
<li> (MacOS) If Scrub Toolbar is enabled and you remain hovered over a button after clicking it, the button tooltip may incorrectly change to "Hide Scrub Ruler" (or to "Show Scrub Ruler" if Scrub Ruler is turned off).</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Spectrograms">Spectrograms</span></h3>
<ul><li> (Linux) <b>On some monitors with limited vertical resolution and also on some 4K monitors, the Preview, Help, Cancel and OK buttons in the per-track Spectrograms settings window cannot be accessed.</b> It may help to switch to a window system such as Ubuntu Unity that can put the operating system Taskbar buttons at the side.</li>
<li> A <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://manual.audacityteam.org/o/man/spectral_selection.html">Spectral Selection</a> created in Spectrogram view currently only works with the three specific <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://manual.audacityteam.org/o/man/spectral_selection.html#edit">spectral edit effects</a>. These effects can also only be used while in Spectrogram view and require that Spectral Selection be checked "on" in either the Track Control Panel for the track or in Spectrogram Preferences. All other effects and for example cut or delete will act on the entire spectrum in the time range regardless of the spectral selection.</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Sync-Locked_Track_Groups">Sync-Locked Track Groups</span></h3>
<ul><li> <b>If Sync-Locked Track Groups are enabled but "Editing a clip can move other clips" in Tracks Preferences is disabled</b>, sometimes not all sync-lock-selected tracks will be affected by Timeline-changing edits, and sometimes audio clips may be removed. You can Edit &gt; Undo any unwanted changes.</li>
<li> <b>If you have unselected Spectrogram or Note (MIDI) tracks in a Sync-Locked Track Group and there is a selected time range, the Note or Spectrogram tracks may show only an indistinct "clocks" indication </b> that they will be affected in that time range by an operation applied to other tracks in the Group.</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Time_Tracks">Time Tracks</span></h3>
<ul><li> The lower and upper speed limits are not stored in the project, so will be restored to their default values of 90 and 110 respectively when reopening or recovering a project, or if removing a Time Track then undoing removal. Please make a note of the correct values before closing the project or the Time Track.</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Timer_Record">Timer Record</span></h3>
<ul><li> (Mac) <b>The Timer Record setup, "Waiting" and "Progress" dialogs may show the date in UK dd/mm/yy format</b> even if the language in System Preferences is set to "US English". The exact behaviour may depend on the machine or version of OS X.</li>
<li> (MacOS and Linux) <b>If Timer Record is set to "Exit Audacity" after recording completes, a crash will be reported on exit.</b> The project and/or audio file will be still be saved correctly.</li>
<li> (Windows and MacOS) <b>On a few machines, Timer Record may not respond to a request to stop the recording or may carry on recording past the scheduled end time.</b> The Elapsed and Remaining Time counters may stop counting. In this case it will be necessary to force quit Audacity. On a few affected machines, the problem can be avoided if you leave focus on Audacity or ensure it has focus when recording is due to end.</li>
<li> Timer Record cannot maintain scheduled duration if system clock changes</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Toolbars">Toolbars</span></h3>
<ul><li>(Windows XP) <b>Transport and Tools Toolbar buttons all display as Pause buttons.</b> The buttons may redraw correctly if you hover over them. <b>Workaround:</b> You can use <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://manual.audacityteam.org/o/man/keyboard_shortcut_reference.html">keyboard shortcut alternatives</a> for the buttons instead.</div></li></ul>
