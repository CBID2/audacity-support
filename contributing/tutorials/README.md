  Tutorials are an awesome way to help out Audacity users. So if you know how to
  use Audacity, you might be just the right person to teach others! You can
  either write guides, or make videos.

# Making Tutorials and User Guides

## Writing Tutorials and User Guides

You can become an editor on Gitbook (ie this website) by making an account and then going to [audacityteam.org/gitbook-access](https://audacityteam.org/gitbook-access)

Editors can edit existing pages (including the stubs found at [todo](../../todo/ "mention")), but cannot create new ones. If you'd like to make a page about a new topic, write to LWinterberg in the [discord server](https://discord.gg/audacity). You also can hand in Markdown files or Word documents to him directly to add.

Gitbook works a bit like a wiki in that you can edit all pages freely, but unlike a wiki, it uses git's "everyone has their own branch" principle. This is to say that the changes you make are independent of everyone else's changes, and won't show up on the main (live) website until the branches are merged.&#x20;

To some degree, this means that you can do whatever you want in your branch. That said, there's some things which make things easier for everyone involved:&#x20;

**Best practice**

1.  **Do one task per branch.** Want to make a new guide on a new feature? Make a new branch. Want to remove all instances of the oxford comma? Make another branch. You can click the branch icon in the top bar to make new branches. ![](../../.gitbook/assets/gitbook-menu.png)

    Doing so makes it easier to understand what your changes are exactly, and should one of your changes be rejected (we like the oxford comma!), most of your other work won't get blocked by it.&#x20;
2. **Only submit complete pages.** Your progress is saved automatically, so if you want to call it for the day, simply close the page and continue the next day. If you accidentally hit "submit", simply start editing again to convert your branch to a draft branch again.
3. **Be aware of the others**, to avoid duplicate work. You may connect with other editors in our discord servers.
4. Follow the [style-guide.md](style-guide.md "mention"), to give this entire site a somewhat uniform style.

## Making Video Tutorials

Video tutorials are highly appreciated as part of a guide. You can upload them to YouTube (or Vimeo/Dailymotion/...) and embed them in your guides, or in other people's guides, like this:&#x20;

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVztuJfhRlU" %}
(example video)
{% endembed %}

We have some requirements for which video tutorials are accepted into Audacity Support pages (see the [Style Guide](style-guide.md#video-tutorials) [#video-tutorials](style-guide.md#video-tutorials "mention") for more info)
