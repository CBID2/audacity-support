If you'd like to contribute make a gitbook account and then go to [https://www.audacityteam.org/gitbook-plugins](https://www.audacityteam.org/gitbook-plugins) to get access to the Plugin space.&#x20;

Alternatively, you can also make a pull request to the [plugins branch on audacity support](https://github.com/audacity/audacity-support/tree/plugins) on Github.

## Requirements for Plugins

* Plugins must work in the current version of Audacity.&#x20;
