# Downloading & Installing Audacity

TODO:&#x20;

* [ ] Windows needs to be slightly less handwavy (people on this page will need the level of detail to follow)
* [ ] macOS
* [ ] Also, it should show some more article on what to do next once it's installed.

{% tab title="Windows" %}
1. Head to the download page: [https://www.audacityteam.org/download/windows/](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/windows/) \
   It will automatically download Audacity after 5 seconds.&#x20;
2. If prompted, click **Run** or **Save**.&#x20;
3. If you clicked Save, head to your downloads, locate the Audacity installer and double-click it.&#x20;
4. When you see the <\<user account control>>, click **Yes**.
5. Follow the installation steps.&#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="macOS" %}
{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** Audacity currently supports Intel hardware only. You need to install Rosetta 2 to use it on Apple Silicon devices.&#x20;
{% endhint %}


{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Linux" %}
1. Head to the download page: [https://www.audacityteam.org/download/linux/](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/linux/)\
   It will automatically download the AppImage after 5 seconds.&#x20;
2.  Make the downloaded AppImage runnable. \
    To do this, you can **right-click** the file **> Properties > Permissions**\
    or run the following command in the terminal:&#x20;

    ```
    chmod +x <path to your Audacity.AppImage>
    ```
3. Double-click the AppImage to run Audacity.&#x20;

Additionally, your Linux distribution (for example Ubuntu, Fedora or Debian) may have a version of Audacity as part of the repository. This version is typically _older_ than the latest AppImage, but may be better integrated into your distribution.&#x20;
