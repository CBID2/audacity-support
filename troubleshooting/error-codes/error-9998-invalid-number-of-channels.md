# Error -9998: Invalid number of channels

## Causes

This error occurs if you try to record an unsupported number of channels.&#x20;

## Fixes

Go to Audio Setup -> Recording channels and choose a different number of channels. Values which typically work are 1 (mono), 2 (stereo), and the highest number presented on the list. So for a 8 channel interface, 8 should work.&#x20;
