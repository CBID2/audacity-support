|           1 | Setup failed to initialize.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|           2 | The user clicked Cancel in the wizard before the actual installation started, or chose “No” on the opening “This will install…” message box.                                                                                                                                                                    |
|           3 | A fatal error occurred while preparing to move to the next installation phase (for example, from displaying the pre-installation wizard pages to the actual installation process). This should never happen except under the most unusual of circumstances, such as running out of memory or Windows resources. |
|           4 | <p>A fatal error occurred during the actual installation process.</p><p><em>Note:</em> Errors that cause an Abort-Retry-Ignore box to be displayed are not fatal errors. If the user chooses <em>Abort</em> at such a message box, exit code 5 will be returned.</p>                                            |
|           5 | The user clicked Cancel during the actual installation process, or chose _Abort_ at an Abort-Retry-Ignore box.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|           6 | The Setup process was forcefully terminated by the debugger (_Run \| Terminate_ was used in the Compiler IDE).                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
