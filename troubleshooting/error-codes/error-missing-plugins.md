# Error: Missing Plugins

## Causes

This is caused by missing [realtime effects](../../audio-editing/using-realtime-effects.md).&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Audacity currently looks for plugins in absolute paths. This means that if you open a project that was created on a different computer, Audacity will continue to check for the plugins in the exact same locations as they were on the old computer.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Fixes

* You can replace any missing effects from the effects sidebar.&#x20;
* Before opening a project on a new computer, ensure that all plugins you've used are in the same location as where they would've been in your old computer.
