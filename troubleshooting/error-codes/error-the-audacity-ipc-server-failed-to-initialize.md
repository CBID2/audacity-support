# Error: The Audacity IPC server failed to initialize

## Causes

If you are on a low-end machine, this may be caused by insufficient resources, specifically memory.&#x20;

This also can happen if you assign yourself a static IP in the `hosts` file.

## Fixes

* Try closing other programs or restarting your computer to clear up memory.&#x20;
* If you're using static IP assignments in the `hosts` file, simply commenting out the assignment may solve this.
