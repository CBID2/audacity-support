# Error -9999: Unanticipated Host Error

## Causes

This error means "something is wrong", most commonly&#x20;

* A lost connection to a USB audio device
* Missing microphone permissions from the operating system.
* Your device is unable to playback other tracks while recording.&#x20;
  * This most commonly happens if you're trying to record at a different sample rate than the device's playback rate. Making sure the sample rate matches in both the Windows Settings and Audacity's **Audio Setup -> Audio Settings** may fix this.&#x20;
  * Turning off Overdub via **Transport -> Transport Options** may fix this.&#x20;
