The Device toolbar has been replaced by the Audio Setup button in version 3.2.0. However, you can re-enable it via **View -> Toolbars -> Device Toolbar.**

## Time Shift Tool

Audacity's Time Shift Tool has been removed in version 3.1.0. It got replaced by drag handles at the top of every clip. You now can time-shift audio without having to switch into a special mode.&#x20;

## Zoom Tool

The Zoom Tool has been removed in version 3.2.0. All of it's functionality can be accessed via the Zoom buttons, or via **`Ctrl+Scroll`** (`Cmd+Scroll`)
