# Missing features

## Audacity Wiki

The Audacity Wiki will shut down soon.

Its replacements are as follows:

* Plugin downloads can be found on [https://plugins.audacityteam.org/](https://plugins.audacityteam.org/), with all plugins hosted in the Wiki being listed in the Nyquist Plugins section.&#x20;
* Developer info can be found on [https://audacity.gitbook.io/dev/](https://audacity.gitbook.io/dev/)&#x20;
* Other contributor instructions can be found on this page: [contributing](../community/contributing/ "mention")
* Changelogs are on this page: [changelog](../additional-resources/changelog/ "mention")
* Help content can be found either on this site, or in [the manual](https://manual.audacityteam.org/).&#x20;
* Information on codecs and audio technology is no longer hosted by us. You may find relevant information on the [hydrogenaudio Wiki](https://wiki.hydrogenaud.io/).

A wikidump of the Audacity Wiki as of March 31, 2023 can be found [in the Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/audacity-wiki). It can be accessed and worked with in the same way as [Wikipedia's dumps](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Data\_dumps).&#x20;

## Device preferences

The Device preference page has been renamed to **Audio Settings**.

## Project Rate

Project Rate has been renamed to **Project Sample Rate** and moved into the **Audio Setup button** -> **Audio Settings**

## Cut, Copy and Paste buttons

The **Cut**, **Copy** and **Paste** buttons have been removed from the **Edit Toolbar** in version 3.2.0.

Audacity version 3.2.3 introduced the **Cut/Copy/Paste Toolbar** which is disabled by default.  Check **View > Toolbars > Cut/Copy/Paste Toolbar** to enable it.

You can also access the Cut/Copy/Paste functionality in the following ways instead:

* **Right-click** the selected audio and choose Cut/Copy/Paste
* In the **Edit menu**, choose Cut/Copy/Paste
* Use **shortcuts**:&#x20;
  * `Ctrl+X` is cut (`Cmd+X` on macOS)
  * `Ctrl+C` is copy (`Cmd+C` on macOS)
  * `Ctrl+V` is paste (`Cmd+V` on macOS)

The Device toolbar has been replaced by the Audio Setup button in version 3.2.0. However, you can re-enable it via **View -> Toolbars -> Device Toolbar.**

## Zoom Tool

The Zoom Tool has been removed in version 3.2.0. All of it's functionality can be accessed via the Zoom buttons, or via **`Ctrl+Scroll`** (`Cmd+Scroll`)

## Time Shift Tool
