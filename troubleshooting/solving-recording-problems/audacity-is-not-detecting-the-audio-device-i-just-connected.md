# Audacity is not detecting the audio device I just connected

## Causes

If you connect an external audio device (such as a USB microphone or USB headset) to your computer while Audacity is already running, it won't be detected automatically by Audacity.

## Fixes

To solve this, make sure the device is detected by the operating system, then go to **Audio Setup -> Rescan Audio Devices** . The new device should appear as an option on the Recording or Playback device selection dropdown in the Device toolbar.
