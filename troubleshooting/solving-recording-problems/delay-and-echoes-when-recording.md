# Delay and echoes when recording

## Causes

Audible input monitoring usually causes a delay (latency) of the live recording input due to the time it takes to reach your headphones.&#x20;

## Fixes

To prevent this, turn input monitoring off. This can be done by choosing **Transport > Transport Options > Enable audible input monitoring** and clicking it to remove the check (tick) mark.

To listen to the live recording input without playthrough latency requires **hardware** monitoring - that is; the input signal must be routed directly through the audio device from the input to the output rather than being passed through software from input to output.
