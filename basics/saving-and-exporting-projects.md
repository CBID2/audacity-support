  There are two ways to get your work out of Audacity: Saving the project, and
  exporting audio.

# Saving and exporting projects

## Saving projects (.aup3)

You can save projects using the **File -> Save Project -> Save Project** menu. A saved project has the most information about your project available. If you save a project, you can change [realtime effects](../audio-editing/using-realtime-effects.md) later on, or untrim clips.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Warning:** Avoid saving active projects on external drives, USB sticks, or network storage. Audacity requires fast, uninterrupted access to your storage when recording and editing.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Exporting audio (.mp3, .wav, .ogg, ...)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** You may need to [install FFMPEG](installing-ffmpeg.md) to access some of these options.
{% endhint %}

You can export your project into an audio file using the **File -> Export Audio...** menu item. Exported audio files can be opened with a wide variety of programs.

**Tips & Tricks**

* Use mono if you don't need directionality (eg. if you're just recording your voice).
* As an alternative to MP3, the Opus and M4A (AAC) options deliver higher quality at the same file size compared to MP3.
* As an alternative to WAV, the FLAC and Wavpack options offer lossless compression, reducing file sizes by up to half while not losing any information.
