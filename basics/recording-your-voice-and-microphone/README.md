# Recording your Voice & Microphone

Audacity can record various types of microphones,&#x20;

## 1. Connect your Microphone

You can connect your mic by plugging it into the appropriate port. In general, this means:&#x20;

* If you have a USB mic, plug it into a USB port.
* If you have a mic with a 3.5mm jack, plug it into a mic-in port.
* If you have an XLR mic, plug it into an XLR-USB audio interface and the interface into the USB port.&#x20;

The exact details depend on both your exact computer model and your microphone model. Please see their respective manuals or support pages for further information. You may need adapters if your computer is missing appropriate ports.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** Many Laptops and Notebooks feature built-in microphones. While they may be good enough to record your voice to an intelligible standard, the recordings they produce tend to be somewhat unpleasant to listen to.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## 2. Select your Microphone

When you open Audacity, you will see a toolbar with four dropdowns:

![The Device Toolbar. The second dropdown controls the microphone.](../../.gitbook/assets/device\_toolbar.png)

The dropdown next to the microphone symbol lets you choose the microphone. You may see some unexpected devices here (for example, webcams), as well as virtual devices (software pretending to be a microphone). Choose the entry that matches the microphone you actually want to use.&#x20;

In the dropdown right next to it, you also can select whether you'll be recording in Mono or Stereo.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** Most microphones are in Mono, and Mono is generally the best choice for recordings. Only use Stereo if you do need directionality.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## 3. Test your Settings

Turn on the monitoring (shown below) and tap onto your mic. If you see the green bar move when tapping the mic, you have selected the correct device in the previous step.&#x20;

![The input level monitor](<../../.gitbook/assets/click to start monitoring>)

Then try to speak in a normal volume. In general, the volume should remain in the green zone throughout (in general, between -18 and -12 dB is best).

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Caution:** If your input volume is too low (below -42 dB) or too high (frequently in the red area), your audio quality will likely suffer. See this page for how to fix this:[setting-recording-levels-and-playback-levels.md](setting-recording-levels-and-playback-levels.md "mention")&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Next, make a test recording. To start recording your voice in Audacity, simply press the red record button.&#x20;

![Transport toolbar: the record button is the second from the right](../../.gitbook/assets/transport\_toolbar.png)

When you have made the recording, listen back to it. If everything went well, you should now hear your voice clearly and you should now be able to continue with the next steps.

## Next Steps

* Once you've made your recording, make sure to save your work. This applies regardless of whether you intend on editing it later or not. [saving-and-exporting-projects](../saving-and-exporting-projects/ "mention")
