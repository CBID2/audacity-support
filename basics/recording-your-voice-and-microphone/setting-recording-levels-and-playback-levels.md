# Setting Recording Levels and Playback Levels

The recording and playback levels can be set in the Mixer toolbar:&#x20;

![The Mixer Toolbar: Recording level on the left, playback volume on the right.](<../../.gitbook/assets/mixer toolbar.png>)

* The slider with the microphone icon sets the recording volume on a system level. If the operating system is prohibiting this action, this slider will be inactive.&#x20;
* The slider with the speaker icon sets the playback volume relative to the system volume. It does not affect the volume of exported files, use the gain sliders on each track to edit those.&#x20;

**Best practice:** Before starting a recording, click on the recording meter to monitor the recording levels: ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (5) (1).png>)

It it enters the yellow or red area (-9 dB to 0 dB) when testing with a normal volume, lower the recording level to prevent clipping and distortions in the real recording.&#x20;
