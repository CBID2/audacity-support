With Audacity 3.2 you can quickly share audio online using the new service [audio.com](https://audio.com). To do this, simply click the **Share Audio** button.

You can now upload your audio by pressing **Continue**. If you'd like to link an existing audio.com first, you can do that by clicking **Link Account**.

Audacity will now prepare the track for upload and upload your audio.

**Note:** This may take a few minutes depending on how fast your computer is, how fast your internet connection is, and how long your audio is.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

After your audio has been uploaded, press **Continue**. You will be taken to the audio.com website.

All uploaded audio is private by default. Only people with access to the link can listen to it.
